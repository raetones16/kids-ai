# Storage Service Modularization

## Overview

The StorageService has been modularized to improve maintainability and make the codebase more manageable. The original monolithic StorageService.js (918 lines) has been split into several smaller, focused services.

## Architecture

The modular storage system consists of the following components:

1. **BaseStorageService** - Contains shared functionality for backend availability checking and data mapping
2. **ProfileStorageService** - Handles child profile data operations
3. **ConversationStorageService** - Manages conversations and messages
4. **SettingsStorageService** - Handles application settings and PIN management
5. **UsageAnalyticsService** - Provides usage statistics functionality
6. **StorageMigrationService** - Handles data migration between localStorage and backend
7. **StorageService (index.js)** - Composes all services together while maintaining the original API

## Dependencies Between Services

The services have the following dependencies:

```
BaseStorageService <---- All other services extend this
      ↑
      |
ProfileStorageService <---- ConversationStorageService
                                    ↑
                                    |
                              UsageAnalyticsService
```

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility, the main StorageService (index.js) implements the same API as the original StorageService.js. This means existing code that uses StorageService will continue to work without changes.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to consider:

1. Replace direct localStorage access with an abstract storage interface
2. Add more comprehensive test coverage for each service
3. Improve error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Provide enhanced TypeScript typings for better developer experience

## Usage

```javascript
// Import the modularized storage service
import { StorageService } from './services/storage';

// Use it exactly as before
const storageService = new StorageService();

// All original methods are still available
const profiles = await storageService.getChildProfiles();
```
