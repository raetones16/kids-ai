# Kids-AI Backend Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Backend Server
- Set up a Node.js/Express server for the backend
- Implemented proper error handling and CORS configuration
- Created a health check endpoint for monitoring

### 2. Database Integration
- Created database connection using Turso (SQLite-based distributed database)
- Designed database schema for profiles, conversations, and messages
- Created fallback to in-memory SQLite for development
- Provided schema initialization and migration utilities

### 3. API Endpoints
- **Profiles API**: Create, read, update, delete child profiles
- **Conversations API**: Manage conversations and messages
- **Settings API**: Store and retrieve application settings
- **Search API**: Proxy for Brave Search API
- **Migration API**: Import data from localStorage

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Created ApiService to communicate with the backend
- Updated StorageService to support both localStorage and backend APIs
- Implemented MigrationModal for transitioning from localStorage to backend
- Added search functionality via the backend proxy

## How to Use

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. On first launch, you'll be prompted to migrate data from localStorage to the backend (if the backend is available).

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the Parent Dashboard**:
   - Enhance conversation history viewing
   - Add profile management features
   - Implement usage statistics

2. **Add Search Integration to Conversations**:
   - Integrate the search results with the conversation flow
   - Add visual indicator for search state

3. **Refine the Backend**:
   - Add authentication for backend APIs
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add comprehensive error handling

4. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Set up Turso database in production
   - Deploy backend to a hosting service like Render.com
   - Configure environment variables for production

## Technical Decisions

1. **Turso Database**: We chose Turso because it provides a SQLite-compatible database with cloud hosting options, making it easy to develop locally and deploy to production.

2. **Hybrid Storage Approach**: The StorageService supports both localStorage and backend API storage, with automatic fallback to localStorage if the backend is unavailable, ensuring the app works even without an internet connection.

3. **Migration Modal**: We implemented a modal to handle the migration process, making it explicit to users and ensuring data integrity during the transition.

4. **Backend Search Proxy**: Using a backend proxy for Brave Search avoids CORS issues and keeps API keys secure.

5. **React Integration**: The frontend components and services were designed to work with both storage methods, minimizing code changes required for the transition.
