# Password Hashing Implementation

This document explains how to implement password hashing in your Kids AI application.

## What's Included

1. **Password Hashing Script**: Migrates existing passwords to hashed versions and adds a second parent account
2. **Authentication Update**: Modified login process to use bcrypt for secure password verification
3. **Account Creation Script**: Simple script to add new parent accounts any time

## Installation Steps

1. First, install bcrypt:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/tim.prudames/kids-ai/backend
   npm install bcrypt
   ```

2. Run the password hashing migration script:
   ```bash
   node update-password-hashing.js
   ```
   This script will:
   - Update any existing parent accounts to use hashed passwords
   - Add a second parent account with username "parent2" and password "password456"
     (You can edit these in the script before running if needed)

3. Restart your backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Creating Additional Parent Accounts

To create new parent accounts at any time, use the included script:

```bash
node add-parent-account.js
```

This will prompt you for:
- Account ID (e.g., "parent3")
- Username
- Password

## Security Notes

- Passwords are now hashed with bcrypt before storage
- Original plaintext passwords are never saved to the database
- The login process now securely compares passwords using bcrypt
- This implementation follows standard security practices for handling credentials

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure bcrypt was installed correctly
2. Check the console output for any error messages
3. The original default parent account should still work (username: "parent", password: "password123")
