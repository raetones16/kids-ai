# Database Schema Fix for Child Profile Deletion

This document explains how to fix the child profile deletion functionality by updating the database schema to properly cascade deletions from profiles to conversations and messages.

## The Problem

The original database schema was missing the `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints on foreign key relationships, which meant that when a child profile was deleted:

1. The profile record was removed from the `child_profiles` table
2. But related conversations in the `conversations` table remained orphaned
3. And their associated messages in the `messages` table also remained orphaned

## The Solution

The fix includes:

1. Updating the database schema to include proper cascading delete constraints
2. Enhancing error handling and logging in the profile deletion process
3. Improving the frontend service that handles profile deletion

## How to Apply the Fix

Follow these steps to apply the fix to your development environment:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/tim.prudames/kids-ai/backend
   ```

2. Run the database schema fix script:
   ```
   node fix-db-schema.js
   ```

3. Restart your backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## What the Fix Does

1. Drops and recreates all tables with proper ON DELETE CASCADE constraints
2. Adds proper error handling and verification in the profile deletion endpoint
3. Enhances the frontend profile deletion service for better error handling

Since you're working with test data, this approach completely resets the database with the correct schema, which is the cleanest solution.

## Verifying the Fix

After applying the fix, test the profile deletion functionality:

1. Create a new child profile
2. Create some conversations for that profile
3. Delete the profile
4. Verify that all associated conversations and messages are also deleted

The backend console logs will show detailed information about the deletion process, including counts of deleted conversations and messages.
